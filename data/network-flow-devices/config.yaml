  This dashboard has several pages of default views applicable to the `KFlow` events received from Kentik's network integration with New Relic One.
  This dashboard also uses custom visualizations that will need to be added to your account from the Global Catalog.

# You can optionally add extra data sources, but this is only needed in certain cases.
# For example if you use data from Prometheus exporters, or custom API you can add that information here.
# You can also redirect to external webpages when the dashboards provides specific installation instructions
